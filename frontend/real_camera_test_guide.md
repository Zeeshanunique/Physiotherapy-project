# 🎥 Real Camera Mode Test Guide

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Pose Detection Status Management**
- ✅ **Fixed status flow**: `initializing` → `ready` → `detecting`
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Proper error states and logging
- ✅ **Status validation**: Session start now properly checks pose detection status

### **2. Camera Start Flow**
- ✅ **Sequential startup**: Camera → Pose Detection → Session
- ✅ **Enhanced logging**: Detailed status tracking
- ✅ **Error recovery**: Graceful fallback on failures

## 🚀 **Test Steps for Real Camera Mode:**

### **Step 1: Start Camera**
1. **Click "Start Camera"** button
2. **Allow camera permissions** when prompted
3. **Check console logs** for:
   ```
   🎯 Camera started, now starting pose detection...
   🎯 startPoseDetection called with: {isCameraEnabled: true, ...}
   🎯 Starting MediaPipe camera...
   ✅ MediaPipe camera started successfully
   ```

### **Step 2: Verify Pose Detection**
1. **Look for pose overlay** on video feed
2. **Check console** for pose detection logs:
   ```
   📹 Pose detection callback triggered {hasLandmarks: true, ...}
   ```

### **Step 3: Select Exercise & Start Session**
1. **Select an exercise** from dropdown (e.g., "bicep_curl")
2. **Click "Start Session"** button
3. **Check console** for session start logs:
   ```
   🚀 startSession called with state: {selectedExercise: "bicep_curl", ...}
   🔄 Starting session initialization...
   ✅ Exercise session started: bicep_curl
   ```

### **Step 4: Verify Real-time Prediction**
1. **Perform the exercise** in front of camera
2. **Check console** for real-time logs:
   ```
   🎯 Session is running, calculating joint angles...
   📐 Calculated joint angles: {...}
   🎯 Sending angles to backend: Shoulder=120.5°, Elbow=60.2°, ...
   📡 Sending prediction to backend...
   📊 Prediction: bicep_curl (85.2%) - Reps: 1
   ```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- Camera feed shows with pose overlay
- Console shows "MediaPipe camera started successfully"
- Session starts without validation errors
- Real-time joint angles sent to backend
- Repetition counting works

### **❌ Common Issues & Solutions:**

**Issue**: "Pose detection not active" error
- **Solution**: Wait for camera to fully initialize (5-10 seconds)

**Issue**: No pose overlay on video
- **Solution**: Check browser console for MediaPipe errors

**Issue**: Session starts but no predictions
- **Solution**: Ensure you're performing the selected exercise

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips:**

1. **Check browser console** for detailed logs
2. **Verify camera permissions** are granted
3. **Ensure good lighting** for pose detection
4. **Stand 2-3 meters** from camera for best results
5. **Perform exercises slowly** for better detection

## 🎉 **Success!**

When working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Real camera feed with pose overlay
- ✅ Live joint angle calculations
- ✅ Real-time ML predictions from backend
- ✅ Accurate repetition counting
- ✅ Exercise phase detection (up/down)

The real camera mode now works exactly like test mode, but with actual pose detection!
